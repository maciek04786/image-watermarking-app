# image-watermarking-app

This is a simple, but effective watermarking app I made for my portfolio, it can apply watermarks to multiple images at a time. Not having requirements,
I got a bit too ambitious and had to leave some of the features out, as I couldn't get them to work properly, like image preview. I might improve it
in the feature, because it cost me a lot of blood and sweat to make it work and who knows, it might have potential for commercial use.

The app itself let's you choose between image and text watermark, there's lots of options like custom size, calculated in relation to base image size.
You can also choose transparency, positioning, where there's 5 options, I might change it to custom positioning as well. There's a few fonts to choose from,
with an option to choose font color.
